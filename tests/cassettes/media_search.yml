        New Look at the Apollo 11 Landing Site/collection.json\",\"data\":[{\"description\":\"Apollo
        11 landed on the Moon on July 20th, 1969, a little after 4:00 in the afternoon
        Eastern Daylight Time. The Lunar Module, nicknamed Eagle and flown by Neil
        Armstrong and Edwin \\\"Buzz\\\" Aldrin, touched down near the southern rim
        of the Sea of Tranquility, one of the large, dark basins that contribute to
        the Man in the Moon visible from Earth. Armstrong and Aldrin spent about two
        hours outside the LM setting up experiments and collecting samples. At one
        point, Armstrong ventured east of the LM to examine a small crater, dubbed
        Little West, that he'd flown over just before landing.  The trails of disturbed
        regolith created by the astronauts' boots are still clearly visible in photographs
        of the landing site taken by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) narrow-angle
        camera (LROC) more than four decades later.  LROC imagery makes it possible
        to visit the landing site in a whole new way by flying around a three-dimensional
        model of the site. LROC scientists created the digital elevation model using
        a stereo pair of images. Each image in the pair shows the site from a slightly
        different angle, allowing sophisticated software to infer the shape of the
        terrain, similar to the way that left and right eye views are combined in
        the brain to produce the perception of depth.  The animator draped an LROC
        photograph over the terrain model. He also added a 3D model of the LM descent
        stage\u2014the real LM in the photograph looks oddly flat when viewed at an
        oblique angle.  Although the area around the site is relatively flat by lunar
        standards, West Crater (the big brother of the crater visited by Armstrong)
        appears in dramatic relief near the eastern edge of the terrain model. Ejecta
        from West comprises the boulders that Armstrong had to avoid as he searched
        for a safe landing site.  Apollo 11 was the first of six increasingly ambitious
        crewed lunar landings. The exploration of the lunar surface by the Apollo
        astronauts, when combined with the wealth of remote sensing data now being
        returned by LRO, continues to inform our understanding of our nearest neighbor
        in space.\",\"date_created\":\"2014-07-18T00:00:00Z\",\"nasa_id\":\"A New
